                <b>What is a liver disease?</b>

                <br>

                Any condition that damages the liver and prevents it from functioning well. The term "liver disease"
                applies to many conditions that stop the liver from working or prevent it from functioning well.
                Abdominal pain or swelling, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice), or abnormal results of liver
                function tests may suggest you have liver disease.

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Why does liver disease?</b>

                <br>

                Liver disease can be inherited (genetic). Liver problems can also be caused by a variety of factors that
                damage the liver, such as viruses, alcohol use and obesity. The most common causes are hepatitis and
                other viruses, and alcohol abuse. Other medical problems can also cause it. The damage to the liver
                usually can't be reversed. The goal of treatment is to slow down the buildup of scar tissue and prevent
                or treat any problems that happen. What are the 4 warning signs of a damaged liver?
                yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice) swelling in the legs, ankles and feet caused by a
                build-up of fluid (oedema) swelling in your abdomen caused by a build-up of fluid known as ascites. a
                high temperature and shivering attacks. Over time, liver disease can cause cirrhosis (scarring). As more
                scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, the liver can no longer function properly. Left untreated,
                liver disease can lead to liver failure and liver cancer.

                <br>

                Some liver problems can be treated with lifestyle modifications, such as stopping alcohol use or losing weight, typically as part of a medical program that includes careful monitoring of liver function. Other liver problems may be treated with medications or may require surgery.
