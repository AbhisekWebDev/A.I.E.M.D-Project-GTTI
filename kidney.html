                <b>What is a kidney disease?</b>

                <br>

                Kidney disease means your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood the way they should. You are at
                greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes or high blood pressure. If you experience kidney
                failure, treatments include kidney transplant or dialysis. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most
                common causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Why does the kidney disease occurs?</b>

                <br>

                Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney disease. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. But also heart
                disease and obesity can contribute to the damage that causes kidneys to fail. Urinary tract issues and
                inflammation in different parts of the kidney can also lead to long-term functional decline. Being
                hospitalized, especially for a serious condition that requires intensive care.

                <b>How are kidney diseases treated?</b>

                <br>

                An alternative to dialysis for people with severely reduced kidney function is a kidney transplant. This
                is often the most effective treatment for advanced kidney disease, but it involves major surgery and
                taking medicines (immunosuppressants) for the rest of your life to stop your body attacking the donor
                organ. There is no cure for kidney failure, but it is possible to live a long life with treatment.
                Having kidney failure is not a death sentence, and people with kidney failure live active lives and
                continue to do the things they love. <br>
                What are 2 main treatments for kidney disease?
                There are two treatment options for kidney failure: dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) and
                kidney transplantation. Talk with your family so you can decide which treatment will best fit your
                lifestyle needs.
