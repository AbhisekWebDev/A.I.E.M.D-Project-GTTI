                <b>What is a muscle disease?</b>

                <br>

                Muscle pain, or myalgia, is a sign of an injury, infection, disease or other health problem. You may
                feel a deep, steady ache or random sharp pains. Some people have muscle pain all over, while others have
                it in specific areas. Everyone experiences muscle pain differently. People of all ages and genders can
                have sore muscles. When you try a new physical activity or switch up your exercise routine, you may
                experience delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Muscle aches may come on six to 12 hours after a
                workout and last up to 48 hours. You feel pain as the muscles heal and get stronger.

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>How are muscle diseases treated?</b>

                <br>

                How do healthcare providers diagnose muscle pain’s cause? <br>
                If you don’t know what’s causing muscle pain, or the pain is severe or chronic, your healthcare provider
                may order tests, such as:<br>

                Blood tests to check enzyme, hormone and electrolyte levels and test for infections.<br>
                MRI or CT scan to look for muscle injury or damage.<br>
                Electromyography to measure electrical activity in nerves and muscles.<br>
                Muscle biopsy to look for muscle tissue changes that may indicate neuromuscular diseases.<br>
                How is muscle pain managed or treated?<br>
                Depending on the cause, these steps may help you feel better:<br>

                Rest and elevate the painful area.<br>
                Alternate between ice packs to reduce inflammation and heat to improve blood flow.<br>
                Soak in a warm bath with Epsom salts or take a warm shower.<br>
                Take over-the-counter pain relievers (aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen).<br>
                Try complementary therapies, such as massage, meditation or acupuncture.<br>
