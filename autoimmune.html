                <b>What is an autoimmune disease?</b>

                <br>

                The immune system usually guards against bacteria and viruses. When it senses these foreign invaders, it
                sends out an army of fighter cells to attack them.

                Usually, the immune system can tell the difference between foreign cells and your own cells.

                In an autoimmune disease, the immune system mistakes part of your body, like your joints or skin, as
                foreign. It releases proteins called autoantibodies that attack healthy cells.

                Some autoimmune diseases target only one organ. Type 1 diabetes damages the pancreas. Other diseases,
                like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or lupus, can affect the whole body.

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Why does the immune system attack the body?</b>

                <br>

                Doctors don’t know exactly what causes the immune system to misfire. Yet some people are more likely to
                get an autoimmune disease than others.

                According to a 2014 study, women get autoimmune diseases at a rate of about 2 to 1 compared to men —
                6.4% of women versus 2.7% of men. The disease often starts during childbearing age (ages 15 to 44).

                Some autoimmune diseases are more common in certain ethnic groups. For example, lupus affects more
                African American and Hispanic people than white people.

                Certain autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and lupus, run in families. Not every family
                member will necessarily have the same disease, but they inherit a susceptibility to an autoimmune
                condition.

                Because the incidence of autoimmune diseases is rising, researchers suspect environmental factors like
                infections and exposure to chemicals or solvents might also be involved.

                A “Western diet” is another suspected risk factor for developing an autoimmune disease. Eating high fat,
                high-sugar, and highly processed foods are thought to be linked to inflammation, which might set off an
                immune response. But this hasn’t been proven.

                BOTTOM LINE: Researchers don’t know exactly what causes autoimmune diseases. Genetics, diet, infections,
                and exposure to chemicals might be involved.

                <b>Autoimmune disease symptoms</b>

                <br>

                The early symptoms of many autoimmune diseases are very similar, such as:

                <br>

                fatigue <br>
                achy muscles <br>
                swelling and redness <br>
                Low grade fever <br>
                trouble concentrating <br>
                numbness and tingling in the hands and feet <br>
                hair loss <br>
                skin rashes


                <br>
                <br>

                <b>How are autoimmune diseases treated?</b>

                <br>

                Treatments can’t cure autoimmune diseases, but they can control the overactive immune response and bring
                down inflammation or at least reduce pain and inflammation. Drugs used to treat these conditions
                include:

                nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Naprosyn)
                immune-suppressing drugs
                Treatments are also available to relieve symptoms like pain, swelling, fatigue, and skin rashes.

                Eating a well-balanced diet and getting regular exercise may also help you feel better.

                BOTTOM LINE: The main treatment for autoimmune diseases is with medications that bring down inflammation
                and calm the overactive immune response. Treatments can also help relieve symptoms.
