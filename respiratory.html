                <b>Why respiratory disease?</b>

                <br>

                Respiratory diseases may be caused by infection, by smoking tobacco, or by breathing in secondhand
                tobacco smoke, radon, asbestos, or other forms of air pollution. Respiratory diseases include asthma,
                chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, and lung cancer.
                Respiratory disease affects one in five people and is the third biggest cause of death in England (after
                cancer and cardiovascular disease). Lung cancer, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
                (COPD) are the biggest causes of death. Respiratory illness is a common problem in the United States.
                Some people are genetically more likely to get respiratory conditions, but your work place or
                environmental exposures can play a big role. One thing is for sure, smoking is the most common cause of
                respiratory disease.
