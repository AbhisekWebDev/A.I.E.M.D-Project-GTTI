                <b>What is an eye disease?</b>

                <br>

                If you’re experiencing itchy eyes without an easily identifiable reason, you may have allergies that
                affect your eyes. Allergies occur when your immune system cannot process something in the environment —
                or perceives it as harmful and overreacts.

                This can happen when foreign substances (called allergens) come into contact with your eyes’ mast cells.
                These cells respond by releasing a number of chemicals, including histamine, causing an allergic
                reaction. <br> Dry eye that occurs when tears aren't able to provide adequate moisture.
                Risk of acquiring this condition increases with age. It's also seen more commonly among post-menopausal
                women.
                The eye may become dry, red and inflamed. The main symptoms are discomfort and sensitivity to light.
                Prescription and lubricating eye drops can reduce dryness. <br> Vision loss means that a person's
                eyesight is not corrected to a “normal” level. Vision loss can vary greatly among children and can be
                caused by many things.

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Why does the eye disease happens?</b>

                <br>

                The leading causes of blindness and low vision in the United States are primarily age-related eye
                diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. Other
                common eye disorders include amblyopia and strabismus. <br> Common causes of decreased tear production
                include: Aging. Certain medical conditions including Sjogren's syndrome, allergic eye disease,
                rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, graft vs. host disease, sarcoidosis, thyroid disorders or
                vitamin A deficiency. <br> Allergies or viral infections (conjunctivitis), as well as any kind of
                inflammation, may cause watery eyes for a few days or so.

                <br>

                A number of different allergens can trigger an allergic reaction in your eyes, including: <br>

                pollen from grass, trees, or ragweed<br>
                dust<br>
                pet dander<br>
                mold<br>
                smoke<br>
                perfume or makeup<br>
                Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) is the most common type of eye allergy. People tend to experience
                symptoms in the spring, summer, or fall, depending on the kind of pollen that’s in the air. <br>

                Symptoms of SAC include:<br>

                itchiness<br>
                stinging/burning<br>
                redness<br>
                watery discharge

                <b>How are eye diseases treated?</b>

                <br>

                What is the best natural eye treatment?
Salt water, or saline, is one of the most effective home remedies for eye infections. Saline is similar to teardrops, which is your eye's way of naturally cleansing itself. Salt also has antimicrobial properties. Because of this, it only stands to reason that saline can treat eye infections effectively <br> For most people with occasional or mild dry eye symptoms, it's enough to regularly use nonprescription eye drops, also called artificial tears. If your symptoms are persistent and more serious, you have other options. What you do depends on what's causing your dry eyes.

Some treatments focus on reversing or managing a condition or factor that's causing your dry eyes. Other treatments can improve your tear quality or stop your tears from quickly draining away from your eyes.
