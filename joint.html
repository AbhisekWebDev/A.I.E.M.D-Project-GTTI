                <b>What is a joint disease?</b>

                <br>

                What are joint disorders? Joint disorders are diseases or injuries that affect your joints. Injuries can
                happen because of overuse of a joint. Or you could have a sudden injury, such as an accident or a sports
                injury.
                Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Some people call it degenerative joint disease
                or “wear and tear” arthritis. It occurs most frequently in the hands, hips, and knees.

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Why does the joint disease happen?</b>

                <br>

                Overuse is the most common cause, but injuries, infections and other conditions, such as arthritis, can
                cause bursitis. Tendinitis. This condition happens when you overuse a tendon. It swells and makes the
                joint painful to move.
                osteoarthritis is the most common culprit in joint pain. It occurs when the lining of the joints, called
                cartilage, is worn down. Although osteoarthritis can damage any joint, it most commonly affects the
                knees, hands and hips.

                They usually include rest, keeping the injured joint higher than your heart, and taking medicine to reduce swelling. Your provider may recommend gentle exercise and other treatment. In some cases, your provider may suggest an injection (a shot) of medicine into the joint. If these do not help, you may need surgery.
