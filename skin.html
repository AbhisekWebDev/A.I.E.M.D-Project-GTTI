                <b>What is a skin disease?</b>

                <br>

                Skin diseases are conditions that affect your skin. These diseases may cause rashes, inflammation,
                itchiness or other skin changes. Some skin conditions may be genetic, while lifestyle factors may cause
                others. Skin disease treatment may include medications, creams or ointments, or lifestyle changes. Skin
                cancer is one of the most serious conditions dermatologists treat, and while most forms of skin cancer
                are slow progressing, the sooner the treatment begins, the better the patient's prognosis will be.

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Why skin disease happens?</b>

                <br>

                Common causes of skin diseases include: Bacteria trapped in your pores or hair follicles. Conditions
                that affect your thyroid, kidneys or immune system. Contact with environmental triggers, such as
                allergens or another person's skin. Allergies, irritants, genetic makeup, certain diseases, and immune
                system problems can cause skin conditions. Stress can also: Make skin problems worse. For example,
                stress can aggravate psoriasis, rosacea, and eczema. It can also cause hives and other types of skin
                rashes and trigger a flare-up of fever blisters.
